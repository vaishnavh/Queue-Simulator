README FOR QUEUE SIMULATOR

To compile and run the simulator, enter
	> ./run
Ensure permissions have been given to run the script:
	> chmod +x run

The program gets user input from console, for the probability distribution used
and to initialize values for the counters.
Mention either "Poisson" or "Uniform" or "Enumerated" - these are the three
implemented probability distributions.


The output is of the form of time labelled activities, one per line.
The output is synchronized with real-time.
<time_stamp> <activity>
...

The simulation can extend upto a day beyond which time handling has not been
done.

Caution : Any wrong input entered will throw an exception if it does
not prompt the user for corrected value.
